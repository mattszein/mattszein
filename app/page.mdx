You're about to browse my life through my day-to-day workstation interface. Think of it as navigating through the files and folders of my world, from quick terminal commands to deeper dives into my thoughts and projects. Here you'll stumble across random bits of everything: intentionally selected pieces about who I am, articles about whatever nerdy obsessions I'm currently hyperfixated on, some joke that may or may not land, and probably some thoughts that seemed brilliant at 2am.

Whether you're here to explore my work or discover shared interests, I'm excited to connect. Hope you enjoy this journey!

Navigate like a developer ðŸŽ®

This site works differently - instead of clicking with your mouse, you use keyboard keys to move around. It's inspired by how some programmers navigate code efficiently. Look for the cursor (that blinking character): that shows where you are.

So, if you want to move right the cusor, press the key 'l'.

Below you have a list of the keyboard keys that will help you to navigate this site.
