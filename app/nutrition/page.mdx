# Plant-based nutrition üå±

I follow a plant-based diet that aligns with my ethical values, but what started
as ethics has become performance optimization. The difference is tangible: stable
energy, faster recovery, mental clarity.
When your nutrition is properly dialed in (vitamins and minerals balanced, macronutrients covered, gut health optimized) everything just works. Research backs this up, showing plant-based diets increase energy expenditure, reduce systemic inflammation, and improve mental clarity¬π,¬≤.

<br />
## Key Principles üîë
* Diversity matters - Eating 10+ different plants weekly significantly boosts gut bacterial diversity, which directly impacts immune function and inflammation¬≥
* Protein combining is automatic - No need to stress about "complete proteins" at every meal when eating varied whole foods throughout the day
* Habits over restrictions - Focus on building a sustainable lifestyle, not following rigid rules. Plant-based burgers and fries are part of the plan!
* Strategic supplementation - B12 is non-negotiable (50-70% deficiency rate without it‚Åµ), creatine enhances muscle growth and strength‚Å∂. Everything else comes from food

<br />
## My daily strategy üìÖ
For the curious, here's what a typical day looks like:
* 10:30 - Breakfast: My morning smoothie ritual - plant milk, banana, walnuts, protein powder, and creatine. Covers protein, healthy fats, and carbs in one go.
* 12:00 - Pre-training: Coffee. Caffeine genuinely enhances performance during high-intensity exercise‚Å¥.
* 12:30 - Training time
* 14:30 - Lunch: Salted tofu for protein, mixed boiled tubers (potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, carrots, garlic), a big salad with tomatoes, lettuce, arugula, beetroot, olive oil, plus whatever fruit is in season.
* 17:30 - Snack: Usually toast with peanut butter and fruit. Sometimes walnuts or a plant protein bar.
* 21:00 - Dinner: Legume pasta or red lentils cooked with turmeric and spices, saut√©ed vegetables like onion and leek, steamed broccoli, nutritional yeast, and roasted tomatoes.
<br />

## More Science üî¨

Large-scale studies consistently show 8-19% lower risk of heart disease with plant-based diets‚Å∑,‚Å∏. When you're training hard and want to keep doing it for decades, that matters. Plus, recent studies confirm that when total protein intake is adequate, plant-based diets support muscle development just as effectively as omnivorous diets‚Åπ. So you're not sacrificing gains for health.
