# Plant-based nutrition üå±

  I follow a plant-based diet that aligns with my ethical values. For me, it's about more than just food choices, it's a commitment to minimizing harm. But what started as an ethical decision has become one of the best choices I've made.
The difference in how I feel is crucial. My energy levels are stable throughout the day, and recovery from training feels faster. When your nutrition is properly dialed in (vitamins and minerals balanced, macronutrients covered, gut health optimized) everything just works. Research backs this up, showing plant-based diets increase energy expenditure, reduce systemic inflammation, and improve mental clarity¬π,¬≤.

## My daily strategy üìÖ
* 10:30 - Breakfast: My morning smoothie ritual - plant milk, banana, walnuts, protein powder, and creatine. It's basically liquid fuel that covers protein, healthy fats, and carbs in one go.
* 12:00 - Pre-training: Coffee. Not just habit - caffeine genuinely enhances performance during high-intensity exercise‚Å¥.
* 12:30 - Training time
* 14:30 - Lunch: This is where I pack in variety. Salted tofu for protein, mixed boiled tubers (potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, carrots, garlic), a big salad with tomatoes, lettuce, arugula, beetroot, olive oil, plus whatever fruit is in season.
* 17:30 - Snack: Usually toast with peanut butter and fruit. Sometimes walnuts or a plant protein bar if I need extra fuel.
* 21:00 - Dinner: Legume pasta or red lentils cooked with turmeric and spices, saut√©ed vegetables like onion and leek, steamed broccoli, nutritional yeast, and roasted tomatoes.

I always try to eat a huge variety of vegetables because I know it matters for gut health. I usually rotate through different leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, tubers, grains, mushrooms and spices. Studies show that eating over 10 different plants weekly significantly boosts gut bacterial diversity¬≥, and since gut health directly impacts immune function and inflammation, this isn't just nutrition... it's performance optimization.

One thing that simplified my approach was learning that protein combining happens automatically when you eat varied whole foods throughout the day. You don't need to stress about "complete proteins" at every meal.
<br />
I've also learned to embrace nutrition-rich foods as a habit, not a restriction. It's about building a long-term lifestyle that feels natural and sustainable, not following rigid rules. Sometimes I'll grab a plant-based burger or fries, and that's totally fine - what matters is that my daily habits are solid. The consistency of everyday choices carries way more weight than the occasional indulgence.

I keep it simple: B12 and creatine. B12 is non-negotiable since it's not found in plants, and deficiency rates hit 50-70% among vegans who don't supplement‚Åµ. Creatine consistently shows benefits for muscle growth and strength gains when combined with resistance training‚Å∂. Everything else I get from food.

## More Science üî¨

Large-scale studies consistently show 8-19% lower risk of heart disease with plant-based diets‚Å∑,‚Å∏. When you're training hard and want to keep doing it for decades, that matters. Plus, recent studies confirm that when total protein intake is adequate, plant-based diets support muscle development just as effectively as omnivorous diets‚Åπ. So you're not sacrificing gains for health.
