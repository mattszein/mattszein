      <p>{`15+ years of building software, I've worked from scrappy startups to more established companies, solo projects to leading technical teams. And I usually still get excited when I encounter a problem I haven't solved before. Challenges keep me sharp and improve my focus. There's something satisfying about that moment when you finally see the (elegant?) solution to something that seemed impossible an hour ago.`}</p>
      <p>{`Something I've learned is that one of the good parts of working in a tech company isn't just writing code, it's watching other developers level up. I've mentored 7+ developers over the years, and honestly, seeing a junior dev grasp a complex concept and then run with it is similarly satisfying as any own technical achievement. But let's be real, not everything is nice and easy: sometimes a developer can't follow you on something that seems simple, and it feels heavy when you need to solve your own task. Or you're stuck on a bug for hours and the only clue you get is "Cannot read properties of undefined" with absolutely no useful stack trace (react detected). But in the end, it all has its reward.`}</p>
      <p>{`I've realized how crucial clear communication is. Code is communication, documentation is communication, even a simple Slack message matters. Using the right words at the right time directly impacts results, whether someone is explaining a concept to a developer or discussing architecture with stakeholders, clarity saves time and prevents misunderstandings.`}</p>

      <p>{`Currently, I'm studying AI from the basics: its history, the fundamentals, the math behind it, different algorithms and their applications. Plus some Rust or whatever else seems interesting.`}</p>
