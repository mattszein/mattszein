# Coding üíª

15+ years of building software across startups, established companies, and everything in between. I've shipped solo projects and led technical teams. What still gets me out of bed? Encountering problems I haven't solved before.
There's something deeply satisfying about that moment when a (elegant?) solution finally clicks after hours of debugging.

<br />

## Mentorship & Growth ü§ù

One of the best parts of working in tech isn't just writing code, it's watching other developers level up. I've mentored 7+ developers over the years, and honestly, seeing a junior dev grasp a complex concept and then run with it is similarly satisfying as any own technical achievement.

But... mentorship isn't always smooth. Sometimes a developer can't follow you on something that seems simple, and it's frustrating when you have your own tasks piling up. Or you're stuck on a bug for hours and the only clue is "Cannot read properties of undefined" with no useful stack trace (react detected). But these challenges are part of the job, and ultimately, helping someone overcome a difficult concept has its reward and makes both of you better engineers.

<br />

## Communication üì°

I've realized how crucial clear communication is. Code is communication. Documentation is communication. Even a Slack message matters. Using the right words at the right time directly impacts outcomes, whether explaining a concept to a junior dev or discussing architecture with stakeholders, clarity saves time and prevents misunderstandings.

<br />

## Current Focus üìö

I'm currently studying AI from the ground up: its history, fundamentals, the
math behind it, different algorithms and their applications. Also exploring Rust and whatever else seems interesting and useful.

## Learning What Matters

<br />

I need to be honest about my most recent role: I was Tech Lead at an online casino. I took the job because I needed work, and initially rationalized it  as "just a technical challenge." And technically it was: leading a team, architecting scalable systems, solving engineering problems.

But the cognitive dissonance grew. I was building systems explicitly designed to maximize engagement through psychological triggers.
The experience taught me something crucial: technical skill without ethical direction isn't enough. I want to solve problems that make the world better, not just interesting problems. I don't want to build things I don't believe in.

Freelance & Independent Work. üíª

Throughout my career, I've also taken on freelance projects - some between jobs and smaller ones while working full-time. These projects have given me experience working directly with clients across different industries, building custom web solutions and handling specific technical implementations.
