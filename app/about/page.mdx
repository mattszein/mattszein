How difficult it is to talk about who I am... Where should I start? My habits? How do I think? How do I interact with the world? Who knows.. Life is shaped by genetics and environment. The culture, the experience, out actions...
Well, I'll try my best to summarize my roots, which seems like a good place to start.

<br />

## My roots üå≥

I'm someone who grew up right at the height of the technological boom üí•. Born in the '90s, I experienced the pre-internet world: playing with physical toys, listening to the radio and Cds, watching VHS movies. Then came the era of ICQ and mIRC, with those painfully slow modems that made the phone completely unusable... The golden years of Yahoo!!! Without forgetting the mobile revolution from StarTac to the indestructible Nokia 1100.

<br />

  I was lucky we had a computer at home early on. Technology just clicked naturally for me. Maybe it's the nerd-logic combo, the tech stuff just absorbed my neurodivergent brain completely. Spent countless hours playing Prince, Doom, Super Mario... Ice Climber and Battle City are still in my heart. And how can I forget the internet cafes and Age of Empires!

<br />

Started taking apart and building computers at 12, then dove into web development at 13, learning the basics of HTML, CSS and pure JS. Should i mention when i experimented with phishing at that age ? I swear I never did any harm.
I studied a Bachelor of Systems at the Faculty of Informatics of the National University of La Plata(UNLP) in Argentina and I'm also a sound technician.

  There's obviously more to me than just code though. I live pretty quietly -well, at least i try-, staying active and eating plant-based üå±.
You can find me experimenting in the kitchen or behind the decks as a DJ. My music taste jumps from funky disco to industrial techno. My reading bounces between philosophy and weird scientific discoveries.

## My values üí≠

I approach life with the aim of causing the least possible harm and making the world a better place üåç. I've been vegan since 2012 after watching a documentary about what really happens to animals in the industry and in fact that was the key that started me questioning everything.

I was part of founding a vegan activism group, dedicating a huge amount of time to raising awareness about animal rights. I held hundreds of vegan cooking workshops and spoke to thousands of people - both on the street and at organized events. At one point, a friend and I became key figures in the group, encouraging activists to get more involved and engaged.

I believe deeply that knowledge should be free. Information isn't something to hoard, it's how we rationally use it so we help each other make better decisions.

I'm into Effective Altruism, which basically means using evidence and reason to figure out how to do the most good. A mix of skepticism, critical thinking, and empathy are my tools for trying to make things better, whether that's through code or just being a decent human(who can define what decent means...idk ü§∑).
