Born in the '90s, I experienced the pre-internet world: playing with physical toys, listening to the radio, watching VHS movies. Then came the era of ICQ and mIRC, with those painfully slow modems that made the phone completely unusable... The golden years of Yahoo!!! Without forgetting the mobile revolution from StarTac to the indestructible Nokia 1100.`}

Spent countless hours playing Prince, Doom, Super Mario... Ice Climber and Battle City are still in my heart. And how can I forget the internet cafes and Age of Empires!`}

You can find me experimenting in the kitchen or behind the decks as a DJ. My music taste jumps from funky disco to industrial techno. My reading bounces between philosophy, weird scientific discoveries, and oddly fascinating things like how electrons actually flow through copper cables.`}

I've been vegan since 2012 after watching a documentary about what really happens to animals in the industry and in fact that was the key that started me questioning everything. I believe deeply that knowledge should be free. Information isn't something to hoard, it's how we rationally use it so we help each other make better decisions.`}
