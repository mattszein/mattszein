Born in the '90s, so I got to experience the before-internet world and then surf into the ICQ, MSN and cybercaf√© era. All that tech just clicked naturally. Started taking apart and building computers at 12, then dove into web development at 14. I studied a Bachelor of Systems at the Faculty of Informatics of the National University of La Plata (UNLP) and I'm also a sound technician.`}

Actually, I've been vegan since 2012 after watching a documentary about what really happens to animals in the industry - that was the key that started me questioning everything. Ethical living is huge for me: I try to minimize harm where I can and believe deeply that knowledge should be free. Information isn't something to hoard - it's how we help each other make better decisions and build a better world together.`}

My music taste jumps from funky disco to industrial techno. My reading bounces between philosophy, weird scientific discoveries, and oddly fascinating things like how electrons actually flow through copper cables.`}

A mix of skepticism, critical thinking, and empathy are my tools for trying to make things better, whether that's through code or just being a decent human (who can define what decent means...idk).`}
