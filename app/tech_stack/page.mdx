## Software ðŸ’¾

After over a decade with Linux, I've settled into a setup that just works. I've tried various distributions over the years, mostly Debian based. Pop!_OS was my daily driver last years: it strikes the perfect balance between stability and staying out of my way.
But this year (2025) i tried ArchLinux distribution and i really like it, so now I'm
using it with hyprland. It's lightweight, fast, and lets me customize everything to my liking.

For development, I live in neovim (lazyvim) and alacritty terminal. Neovim gives me the speed and customization I need. I use zellij for terminal multiplexing, which lets me manage multiple sessions easily. My shell is zsh with oh-my-zsh, which adds useful features and plugins without being too heavy.

Sometimes I run a trimonitor setup because screen real estate matters. The laptop screen handles browsing and music, the main monitor is for coding, and the third keeps an eye on servers and logs. For ergonomics, I use an Ergodox EZ with Cherry MX switches and an ergonomic mouse... after years of coding, your wrists will thank you.
