        My Training Approach
      </h1>
      <p className="pt-4">
        {`I train 3-4 days a week focusing on muscle gain, mixing traditional gym work with calisthenics. This combination gives me the best of both worlds - the muscle-building power of weightlifting plus the body control and balance that comes from bodyweight movements. You'll find me doing squats, deadlifts, and bench press alongside pull-ups, push-ups, tuck front lever pull-ups, and dips.`}
      </p>
      <p className=" pt-4">
        {`I also dedicate two days weekly to cardio because cardiovascular health matters just as much as strength. Whether it's paddle, HIIT, basketball, soccer, or running - I keep it varied and fun.
        `}

      <h1 className="pt-4 font-bold">Why Training Matters Beyond Gains</h1>
      <p className="pt-4">
        {`
        For me, training goes way beyond just building muscle. It's become essential for my mental and emotional well-being - there's nothing like a good session to clear stress and sharpen focus. But the real motivation is long-term: if you want to reach old age functionally independent and strong, resistance training is your best investment.`}

      <p className="pt-4">
        {`
        Research consistently shows that muscle strength - not just muscle mass - is the strongest predictor of mortality and functional independence in aging¹,². Studies demonstrate that resistance training is the most effective intervention for preventing and treating sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and strength that affects 5-50% of older adults³,⁴. The evidence is clear: maintaining muscle strength through resistance training preserves mobility, reduces fall risk, and maintains independence well into old age⁵,⁶. It's not just about looking good now - it's about being able to carry groceries, climb stairs, and live fully when I'm 80.`}
