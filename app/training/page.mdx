# My Training Approach üèãÔ∏è

I train 3-4 days a week focusing on muscle gain, mixing traditional gym work with calisthenics. This combination gives me the best of both worlds - the muscle-building power of weightlifting plus the body control and balance that comes from bodyweight movements. You'll find me doing squats, deadlifts, and bench press alongside pull-ups, push-ups, tuck front lever pull-ups, and dips.
I also dedicate two days weekly to cardio because cardiovascular health matters just as much as strength. Whether it's paddle, HIIT, basketball, soccer, or running - I keep it varied and fun.

## Why training matters üí™

For me, training goes way beyond just building muscle. It's become essential for my mental and emotional well-being. There's nothing like a good session to clear stress and sharpen focus. But the real motivation is long-term: if you want to reach old age functionally independent and strong, resistance training is your best investment.

Research consistently shows that muscle strength is the strongest predictor of mortality and functional independence in aging¬π,¬≤. Studies demonstrate that resistance training is the most effective intervention for preventing and treating sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and strength that affects 5-50% of older adults¬≥,‚Å¥.
The evidence is clear: maintaining muscle strength through resistance training preserves mobility, reduces fall risk, and maintains independence well into old age‚Åµ,‚Å∂. It's not just about looking good now - it's about being able to carry groceries, climb stairs, and live fully when I'm 80.
