# My Training Approach 🏋️

I train 3-4 days a week focusing on muscle gain, mixing traditional gym work with calisthenics. This combination gives me the best of both worlds: the muscle-building power of weightlifting plus the body control and balance that comes from bodyweight movements.

You'll find me doing squats, deadlifts, and bench press alongside pull-ups, push-ups, tuck front lever pull-ups, and dips.

I also dedicate two days weekly to cardio because cardiovascular health matters just as much as strength. Whether it's paddle, HIIT, basketball, soccer, or running... I keep it varied and fun.

<br />
## Key Principles 🔑
* Hybrid approach - Combining weighted movements (muscle building) with calisthenics (body control and balance)
* Strength as longevity - Muscle strength is the strongest predictor of mortality and functional independence¹,²
* Cardiovascular balance - Two cardio days weekly for heart health and variety
* Sustainable volume - 3 or 4 strength days + 2 cardio days allows recovery and long-term consistency

## Why training matters 💪

Beyond the immediate benefits (stress relief, mental clarity, focus), I train
for longevity. The data is unambiguous: muscle strength is the strongest predictor
of mortality and functional independence in aging¹,². Resistance training is the
most effective intervention for preventing sarcopenia, which affects 5-50% of
older adults³,⁴. Maintaining muscle strength through resistance training preserves mobility, reduces fall risk, and maintains independence well into old age⁵,⁶.
It's not about aesthetics, it's about being able to carry groceries, climb
stairs, and live independently at 80. Every deadlift today is an investment
in future autonomy.

## My Weekly Split 🔥

For those interested in specifics, here's a typical week:

- Monday: Weighted Pull-ups + Squats / Tuck front lever pull-ups + Leg Extension + Weighted Jumps / Barbell Biceps Curl + 1 push exercise
- Tuesday: Cardio - Paddle, HIIT, Basketball, or Soccer
- Wednesday: Bench press + Weighted single leg calf raises / Deadlift + Weighted Dips / 1 back exercise + 1 shoulder or triceps exercise
- Thursday: Cardio - Paddle, HIIT, Basketball, or Running
- Friday: Squats + Weighted Pull-ups / Inclined Bench Press + Leg exercise / Overhead press + Biceps exercise
- Saturday: Free mix of Calisthenics and gym work
